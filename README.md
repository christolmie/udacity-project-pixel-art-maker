## Introduction

The Pixel Art Maker Project is part of the Udacity Intro to Programming Nanodegree. This is my submission to that program.

The task is to use what I have learned about HTML, CSS and Javascript to put together a simple tool to create artistic designs.

## Instructions
Load the page, create a grid using the height and width inputs, pick a colour and draw. Clicking a cell will change the color of the cell to the color you picked. There's no undo, and no way to save it, but true art is supposed to be temporary.

If you want to start again, click on the 'Refresh Grid' button.

Changing the size of the grid will also reset the grid.

NOTE: On Firefox, when you pick a colour, you need to close the color picker for the new color to take effect. Other browsers don't have this "feature".

## Contributing

This code is based on the starter code provided by the Udacity course, but I need to submit my own code, so there really isn't any opportunity to contribute. I would appreciate and suggestions on how I could make it better though.
